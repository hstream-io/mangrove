# mangrove

Mangrove is a database management server with some other facilities.

A mangrove has a huge number of aerial roots, enabling it to have high level of gas exchange, which is just like the I/O level of our databases. Also, a mangrove can survive many rough environments and provides habitats for many other species, as what the project does.

## Run Server

### With `stack`
```
$ stack run <config-file-path>
```

### With `cabal`

```
$ cabal new-run mangrove <config-file-path>
```

## Configuration

The configuration file is in `yaml` format. An example is at `app/config.example.yaml`.
